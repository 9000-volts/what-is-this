# What is this???
I dunno, I'm really just screwing around with random stuff in a github
repository.

My goal is to make it as messy and confusing as possible and still somehow get
it to do something.

## Big o'l list of system requirements

 * Python 3 (accessible via `python` command in terminal)
 * Python Requests module (`pip install requests`)
 * Ruby (accessible via `ruby` command in terminal)
 * Required ruby gems (from Gemfile) installed (`bundle install`)
 * Java JDK (`javac`) and JRE (`java`) version 8 (7 might work, too)
 * Perl 5 (accessible via `perl` command in terminal) (Use strawberryperl.com on windows)
 * NodeJS (accessible via `node` command in terminal)
 * Required nodejs modules (`npm i`)
