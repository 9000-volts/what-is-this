# What is this???
I dunno, I'm really just screwing around with random stuff in a github
repository.

My goal is to make it as messy and confusing as possible and still somehow get
it to do something.

## Big o'l list of system requirements

 * Python 3
 * Python Requests module (pip install requests)
 * Ruby
 * Required ruby gems (from Gemfile) installed (bundle install)
